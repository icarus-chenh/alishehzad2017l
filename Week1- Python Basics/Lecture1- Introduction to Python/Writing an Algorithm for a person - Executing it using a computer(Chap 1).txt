Finger exercise 1:
Computers can be annoyingly literal. If you don’t tell them exactly what you want
them to do, they are likely to do the wrong thing. Try writing an algorithm for driving between two
destinations. Write it the way you would for a person, and then imagine what would happen if that
person were as stupid as a computer, and executed the algorithm exactly as written. How many traffic
tickets might that person get?


Algorithm for reaching Department of Physics from The Great Dome (for a friend)
1.	Head Northwest towards Vassar St for 90 meters.
2.	Turn right and follow the road for 160 meters.
3.	Turn right again and follow the road for 100 meters.
4.	Turn left and follow the road for another 160 meters.
5.	Turn right and you’re now on Ames St.
6.	Make a final right turn and drive another 90 meters. 
7.	Destination is now on your right.

What would happen if I tried executing it on a computer?
If this Algorithm were to be fed into a computer, the autonomous vehicle would break all traffic signals, not slow down over speed bumpers, 
run over people and smash any vehicles/objects in between the journey. My driving license would be rescinded.
