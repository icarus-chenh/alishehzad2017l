Finger Exercise 15: Why does the code use mid+1 rather than mid in the second recursive call?

•To bring the decrementing function closer to 0 as ‘mid’ has already been searched. 
•If we do not add 1 to mid when before passing it as a parameter to ‘low’, the function might run forever in some cases. 
 Try simulating bSearch(L, 4, 3, 4) and see for yourself or look below.
•Every time bSearch is called with these arguments; the value ‘3’ gets assigned to ‘mid’ because of integer division.
 Now mid has the same value as low and this value is passed again and again to the recursive function bSearch making it interminable.
